# mangaka-scrape. (ONGOING)
## Project by Sajina Shrestha 

##  Synopsis: 
#### This is a project on finding data on the translation gap between male and female authors in the Japanese comics industry.

## Context: 
#### Since 2020-21, mangas (Japanese comics) have grown in popularity due to the rise and increased availability of anime. However, a significant portion of the most popular mangas are written by men. Why is it so and have there been attempts to translate more women authors given that women make up a large portion of the manga industry as a whole? 

## Methodology:
#### I collected data on manga releases from before the boom (2018-19) and after (2021-22) and collected them in a dataset. My process is to run the names through Genderize and map the numbers onto a visualizer to see if more women are being translated and also the ratio of the genders of translators.

## Caveats:
#### A lot of Japanese authors work under a pen name, I will have to check for that and make sure to create a separate portion just for authors who don't disclose their gender. Also, genderize works off a gender binary and doesn't account for people who may not identify as male or female,  I will have to disclose this in my reporting. 

## Skills used: 
#### Scraping, Genderize, Spot-checking, Pandas, Conditional Statements etc.
